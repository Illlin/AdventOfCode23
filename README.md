# Advent of code 2023

These are my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023, on some days I have tried to minimise my code and find how small I can make it. These are all rather silly

if you are here looking for a solutions, I would recommend trying to solve them your self.

## Advent of code Golf:
These are much uglier and hard if not impossible to debug, but quite a fun challenge

| Day   |   Size    | Notes|
|:------|:---------:|:--|
| Day 1 |   314B    | Needs more work on part 2 |
| Day 2 |  589[^1]  | No effort |
| Day 3 | 1024[^1]  | No effort |
| Day 4 |   381B    | Part 2 did not have as much effort put in|
| Day 5 | 1041B[^1] | No effort|
| Day 6 | 184B[^2]  | Proud of this mess|
| Day 7 |   467B    | Found out you can bump and next to a number|
| Day 8 | 266B[^2]  | Found a cool numpy function!|

[^1]: No effort put in, ran through minifier
[^2]: Only works on systems where the default long length is 64 not 32, else an extra `dtype=int64` is needed
